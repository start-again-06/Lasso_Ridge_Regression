# Lasso_Ridge_Regression
# 🚀 Droplet Sorting using Lasso & Ridge Regression  

🔬 This project demonstrates the use of **Lasso** and **Ridge Regression** for predicting **droplet size** based on microfluidic parameters like fluorescence intensity, velocity, pressure, and surface tension.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Synthetic Data Generation**: Simulates droplet properties with noise.  
✅ **Feature Scaling**: Standardizes input features for better numerical stability.  
✅ **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**: Performs feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero.  
✅ **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**: Helps with multicollinearity by preventing large coefficient values.  
✅ **Performance Evaluation**: Uses **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to compare both models.  
✅ **Data Visualization**: Plots actual vs. predicted droplet sizes.  

## 📊 Dataset Overview  
The dataset consists of **500 synthetic samples**, each with the following features:  

| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 🔬 **Fluorescence Intensity** | Random values (10-100) |
| 🌊 **Velocity** | Flow speed (0.5-5) |
| 💨 **Pressure** | Applied pressure (1-10) |
| 🧪 **Surface Tension** | Fluid surface tension (20-50) |
| 🎯 **Droplet Size** (Target) | Computed with noise |

## 🛠 Installation  
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:  

```bash
[pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn](url)

🚀 Usage
Run the script to generate a dataset, train models, and visualize results:

bash
Copy
Edit
[python droplet_sorting.py](url)

📉 Model Comparison
The models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE):

Lasso Regression MSE: 📉 (Shows sparsity by ignoring weak features)
Ridge Regression MSE: 📈 (Handles multicollinearity better)
A scatter plot is generated to visualize actual vs. predicted values.

📷 Visualization
The script produces a plot comparing Lasso & Ridge Regression Predictions with actual droplet sizes:


🤖 Future Enhancements
📌 Implement Elastic Net Regression (combining L1 & L2).
📌 Use real microfluidic droplet data instead of synthetic data.
📌 Convert this into a real-time sorting model for microfluidic chips.
